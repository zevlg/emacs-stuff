;;; Synched up with: Not in FSF

;;; Commentary:

;; This program provides prefix key, i.e. special key which in
;; combination with other keys gives C-u (universal-argument)
;; functionality.
;;
;; For example, let prefix key will be P, then:
;;
;;   `P-a' is equivalent to `C-u a', i.e. inserts 'aaaa'
;;
;;   `P-M-!' is equivalent to `C-u M-!', i.e. run shell command and
;;   insert output to current buffer.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;    (set-keymap-default-binding global-map 'pk-command)

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'cl))

;;;###autoload
(defcustom keyboard-prefix-key 'super
  "Modifier to use as prefix key."
  :type '(choice (const :tag "Super" super)
		 (const :tag "Hyper" hyper)
		 (const :tag "Alt" alt)
		 (const :tag "Meta" meta)
		 (const :tag "Control" control))
  :group 'keyboard)


;;;###autoload
(defun pk-command (keys)
  "Default keyboard command."
  (interactive (list (this-command-keys)))

  (let* ((le (car (last (append keys nil)))) ; last key pressed

	 ;; NOTE: we can't just remove `keyboard-prefix-key' from
	 ;; event's modifiers list by side effect, because if
	 ;; `keyboard-prefix-key' is car of that list, it is just
	 ;; impossible, if I wrong please e-mail me.
